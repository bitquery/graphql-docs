# Ethereum Beacon Chain API Overview

Bitquery provides APIs to access Eth2 data. You can get info on the ethereum's staking model. It uses the Proof-of-stake, a consensus method that blockchain networks utilize to reach distributed consensus. 

These APIs provide details on validators, their staked amounts, their exits and so on. The easiest way to start is through the [Beacon Chain Explorer](https://explorer.bitquery.io/eth2)
