The `dexTrades` API allows us to retrieve dex trade data from BNB blockchain.

Here's an example query that fetches 10 latest trades on BNB blockchain:

```
query {
  ethereum(network: bsc) {
    dexTrades(date: {after: "2023-07-17T00:00:00Z"}, options: {limit: 10}) {
      baseCurrency {
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      baseAmount(in: USD)
      buyAmount
      block {
        timestamp {
          iso8601
        }
      }
      buyCurrency {
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      exchange {
        fullName
        fullNameWithId
        address {
          address
          annotation
        }
      }
      quoteCurrency {
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      quoteAmount(in: USD)
      sellAmount
      quotePrice
      sellCurrency {
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      transaction {
        hash
        txFrom {
          address
          annotation
        }
      }
