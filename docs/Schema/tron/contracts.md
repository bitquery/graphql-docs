The `contracts` field allows us to fetch details about contract from Tron blockchain.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use contracts query:

```
{
  tron {
    contracts(
      date: {after: "2023-07-26"}
      options: {desc: "block.timestamp.iso8601", limit: 10}
    ) {
      block {
        timestamp {
          iso8601
        }
      }
      amount
      contractType
      currency {
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      energyUsageTotal
      fee
      netUsage
      txHash
      txOwner {
        address
        annotation
      }
    }
  }
}
```
