# Smart Contract Events

`smartContractEvents` type allows you to retrieve all events emitted by different smart contracts on velas Blockchain.

Here's an exmaple query that retrieves 10 latest events from USDT smart contract from velas Blockchain:

```
query {
  ethereum {
    smartContractEvents (network:velas)(
      smartContractAddress: {is: "0x01445c31581c354b7338ac35693ab2001b50b9ae"}
      options: {desc: "block.timestamp.iso8601", limit: 10}
      date: {after: "2023-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
    ) {
      block {
        timestamp {
          iso8601
        }
      }
      smartContractEvent {
        name
        signature
        signatureHash
      }
      transaction {
        hash
      }
    }
  }
}

```

<summary>Filtering Transactions</summary>

Smart Contract Events can be filtered using following arguments:

- `any`:
- `date`: Filter by date on which smart contract event happened. Date should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`. Available comparision operators are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.
  
- `height`: Filter by height of block where smart contract event happened. Available comparision operators are `between`, `gt`, `gteq`, `in`, `is`, `lt`, `lteq`, `not`, `notIn`.
  
- `options`: Filter returned data by ordering, limiting and constrainting smart contract events data. Available fields: `asc`, `ascByInteger`, `desc`, `descByInteger`, `limit`, `limitBy`, `offset`
  
- `smartContractAddress`: Filter by address of the smart contract. Available comaprision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `smartContractType`: Filter by type of the smart contract on which event happened. Avaiable comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `time`: Filter by time when smart contract event happened. Time should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`. Available comparision operator are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.
  
- `txFrom`: Filter by the address responsible for creating the transaction that emitted an event. Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
  
- `txHash`: Filter by transaction hash of the transaction which emitted smart contract event. Available comparision operators are `is`, `in`, `not`, `notIn`.
