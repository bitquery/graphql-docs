# Smart Contract Calls

`smartContractCalls` type allows you to retrieve smart contract calls made to any smart contract on velas Blockchain.

Here's an example query that retrieves 10 latest smart contract calls amde to USDT smart contract on velas blockchain.

```
{
  ethereum (network: velas){
    smartContractCalls(
      smartContractAddress: {is: "0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955"}
      options: {limit: 10, desc: "block.timestamp.iso8601"}
      date: {after: "2023-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
    ) {
      block {
        timestamp {
          iso8601
        }
      }
      amount
      arguments {
        argument
        argumentType
        index
        value
      }
      callDepth
      gasValue
      smartContract {
        address {

<summary>Filtering Smart Contract Calls</summary>

Smart Contract Calls can be filtered using following arguments:

- `any`:
- `callDepth`: Filter by call depth of smart contract calls. Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `caller`: Filter by caller of that call. Avaiable comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `date`: Filter by date on which smart contract calls was executed. Date should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`. Available comparision operators are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.
- `external`:
- `height`: Filter by height of block where smart contract call was executed. Available comparision operators are `between`, `gt`, `gteq`, `in`, `is`, `lt`, `lteq`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `options`: Filter returned data by ordering, limiting and constrainting smart contract call data. Available fields: `asc`, `ascByInteger`, `desc`, `descByInteger`, `limit`, `limitBy`, `offset
- `smartContractAddress`: Filter by address of the smart contract. Available comaprision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `smartContractMethod`: Filter by method of the smart contract was called. Available comaprision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `smartContractType`: Filter by type of the smart contract on which call happened. Avaiable comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `success`:
- `time`: Filter by time when smart contract call was executed. Time should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`. Available comparision operator are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.
- `txFrom`: Filter by the address responsible for executing smart contract calls. Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `txHash`: Filter by transaction hash of the transaction in which smart contract call was executed. Available comparision operators are `is`, `in`, `not`, `notIn`.
