# Transactions

Bitquery `transactions` API allows you to retrieve all the blockchain transactions from velas Blockchain.

Here's an example query that retrieves 10 latest transactions from Ethereum blockchain:

```
query {
  ethereum (network: velas){
    transactions(
      date: { after: "2023-07-17T00:00:00Z" }
      options: { desc: "block.timestamp.iso8601", limit: 10 }
    ) {
      amount
      block {
        timestamp {
          iso8601
        }
      }
      currency {
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      feePayer
      feeRatio
      gas
      gasCurrency {
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      gasPrice
      gasValue
      hash
      nonce
      sender {
        address
        annotation
      }
      to {
        address
        annotation
      }
      txType
    }
  }
}
```

<summary>Filtering Transactions</summary>

Transactions can be filtered using following arguments:

- `amount`: Filter by amount of tokens transferred in a transaction. Available comparision operators are `between`, `gt`, `gteq`, `in`, `is`, `lt`, `lteq`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `any`:
- `date`: Filter by date on which transaction happened. Date should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`. Available comparision operator are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.

- `feePayer`:
- `feeRatio`:
- `gasCurrency`: Filter by currency used for gas. Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `gasValue`: Filter by gas value used in the transaction. Available comparision operators are `between`, `gt`, `gteq`, `in`, `is`, `lt`, `lteq`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `height`: Filter by height of block where transaction happened. Available comparision operators are `between`, `gt`, `gteq`, `in`, `is`, `lt`, `lteq`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `options`: Filter returned data by ordering, limiting and constrainting transaction data. Available fields: `asc`, `ascByInteger`, `desc`, `descByInteger`, `limit`, `limitBy`, `offset`


- `success`:
  
- `time`: Filter by time when transaction happened. Time should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`. Available comparision operator are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.

- `txCreates`:
  
- `txHash`: Filter by transaction hash of the transaction. Available comparision operators are `is`, `in`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `txIndex`: Filter by index of transaction in the block. Available comparision operators are `is`, `in`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `txSender`: Filter by address of transaction sender. Available comparision operators are `is`, `in`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `txTo`: Filter by address transaction is sent to. Available comparision operators are `is`, `in`, `not`, `notIn`.
  
- `txType`:
