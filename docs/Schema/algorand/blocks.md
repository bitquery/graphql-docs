# Blocks

The `blocks` field allows us to retrieve details about blocks from Algorand blockchain.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to fetch information about 10 latest block from Algorand:

```
{
  algorand {
    blocks(
      options: {desc: "timestamp.iso8601", limit: 10}
      date: {after: "2023-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
    ) {
      currentProtocol
      hash
      height
      nextProtocol
      nextProtocolApprovals
      nextProtocolSwitchOn
      nextProtocolVoteBefore
      previousBlockHash
      proposer {
        address
        annotation
      }
      reward
      timestamp {
        iso8601
      }
      txnRoot
      upgradeApprove
      upgradePropose
    }
  }
}
```

- `any`: A catch-all filter (OR Logic) that can be used to filter the results by any of the other fields.
- `blockHash`: Filter by block hash
- `blockReward`: Filter by block reward
- `currentProtocol`: Filter by current protocol of the block
- `date`: Filter by date on which block is produced
- `height`: Filter by height of the block
- `nextProtocol`: Filter by next protocol of the block
- `options`: Filter returned data by ordering, limiting, and constraining it.
- `proposer`: Filter by address block proposer or list
- `time`: Filter by selecting the date in a range, list or just date
