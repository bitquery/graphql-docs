# Blocks

The `blocks` field allows us to retrieve information about the blocks from the cronos blockchain.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to retrieve 10 latest blocks from cronos blockchains:
```
{
  ethereum (network: cronos){
    blocks(
      options: {limit: 10, desc: "timestamp.iso8601"}
      date: {after: "2023-07-18T00:00:00Z"}
    ) {
      gasLimit
      height
      hash
      timestamp {
        iso8601
      }
      difficulty
      size
      reward
      uncleCount
      transactionCount
      totalDifficulty
    }
  }
}
```

<summary>Filtering Blocks</summary>

Blocks data can be filtered using following arguments:

-   `any`: A catch-all field ( OR Logic) that can be used to filter on any other field in the blocks API.
-   `blockHash`: Filter by block hash.
-   `blockReward`: Filter by block reward given to the block producer.
-   `date`: Filter by the date on which the block was mined.
-   `height`: Filter by the height of the block.
-   `miner`: Filter by the miner who mined the block.
-   `options`: Filter returned data by ordering, limiting, and constraining it. Available fields: `asc`, `ascByInteger`, `desc`, `descByInteger`, `limit`, `limitBy`, `offset`.
-   `size`: Filter by the size of the block.
-   `time`: Filter by when the block was mined.
-   `transactionCount`: Filter by the number of transactions in the block.
