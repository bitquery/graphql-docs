# Attributes

The `attributes` field allows us to retrieve information about the attributes from cosmos networks.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to fetch attributes:

```
{
  cosmos {
    attributes(
      date: {after: "2023-08-05"}
      options: {desc: "block.timestamp.iso8601", limit: 10}
    ) {
      attribute
      block {
        timestamp {
          iso8601
        }
      }
      eventType
      message {
        index
        senders
        success
        type
      }
      transaction {
        hash
        signer {
          address
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
