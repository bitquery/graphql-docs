# Overview

Filecoin is a network built on top of IPFS that allows you store and retrieve data. It uses proof of storage: a minerâ€™s power in the consensus protocol is proportional to the amount of storage it provides. 
Bitquery's filecoin data includes an explorer for easy-viewing and extensive APIs.
