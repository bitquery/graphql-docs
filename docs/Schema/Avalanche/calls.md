Avalanche Smart Contract Calls API allows you to retrieve smart contract calls made to any smart contract on Avalanche network.Below are the fields in the schema:

```
query ($network: EthereumNetwork!, $from: ISO8601DateTime, $till: ISO8601DateTime) {
  ethereum(network: $network) {
    smartContractCalls(
      options: {desc: "block.height", limit: 10, offset: 0}
      time: {since: $from, till: $till}
      external: true
    ) {
      block {
        timestamp {
          time(format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        }
        height
      }
      address: caller {
        address
        annotation
      }
      smartContract {
        address {
          address
          annotation
        }
      }
      smartContractMethod {
        name
        signatureHash
      }
      transaction {
        hash
      }
    }
  }
}
{

  "network": "avalanche",
  "from": "2023-08-25T09:43:35.000Z",
  "till": "2023-08-25T10:13:35.000Z",

<summary>Filtering Smart Contract Calls</summary>

Smart Contract Calls can be filtered using following arguments:

- `any`:
- `callDepth`: Filter by call depth of smart contract calls. Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `caller`: Filter by caller of that call. Avaiable comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `date`: Filter by date on which smart contract calls was executed. Date should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`. Available comparision operators are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.
- `external`:
- `height`: Filter by height of block where smart contract call was executed. Available comparision operators are `between`, `gt`, `gteq`, `in`, `is`, `lt`, `lteq`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `options`: Filter returned data by ordering, limiting and constrainting smart contract call data. Available fields: `asc`, `ascByInteger`, `desc`, `descByInteger`, `limit`, `limitBy`, `offset
- `smartContractAddress`: Filter by address of the smart contract. Available comaprision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `smartContractMethod`: Filter by method of the smart contract was called. Available comaprision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `smartContractType`: Filter by type of the smart contract on which call happened. Avaiable comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `success`:
- `time`: Filter by time when smart contract call was executed. Time should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`. Available comparision operator are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.
- `txFrom`: Filter by the address responsible for executing smart contract calls. Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.
- `txHash`: Filter by transaction hash of the transaction in which smart contract call was executed. Available comparision operators are `is`, `in`, `not`, `notIn`.

</details>

- `amount`: returns amount transferred in the smart contract call
- `any` :
- `arguments`: returns details of the arguments passed while executing smart contract call
- `block`: returns details of block in which smart contract call was executed
- `callDepth`: returns details internal calls that were made in that particular transaction
- `caller`: returns details of address that executed smart contract
- `count`: returns aggregate count of smart contract calls
- `countBigInt`: returns aggregate count of smart contract calls in `BigInt` format
- `date`: returns date on smart contract call was executed
- `expression`: performs arithematic operation and returns value of the operation
- `gasValue`: returns gas consumed by a particular smart contract call
- `maximum`: returns maximum of selected measurable fields of `smartContractCalls`
- `minimum`: returns minimum of selected measurable fields of `smartContractCalls`
- `smartContract`: returns details of smart contract
- `smartContractMethod`: returns details of method to which the call was made
- `success`: returns if calls is successful or not
- `transaction`: returns details of the transaction in which smart contract call was executed
