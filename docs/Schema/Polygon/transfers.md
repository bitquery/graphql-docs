## Transfers

`transfers` type allows you to retrieve currency or token transfers from Ethereum Blockchain.

Here's an example query that retrieves the first 10 transfers of USDT tokens between June 17th and June 18th, 2023. The results are sorted based on the timestamp of each transfer in descending order.

```
query {
  ethereum(network: matic) {
    transfers(
      currency: { is: "0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F" }
      date: { between: ["2023-07-17T00:00:00Z", "2023-07-18T00:00:00Z"] }
      options: { desc: "block.timestamp.iso8601", limit: 10 }
    ) {
      amount
      block {
        timestamp {
          iso8601
        }
      }
      currency {
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      gasValue
      receiver {
        address
        annotation
      }
      sender {
        address
        annotation
      }
      transaction {
        hash
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<summary>Filtering Transfers</summary>

Data retrieved using `transfers` can be filtered using following arguments:

- `amount`: Filter by amount of tokens transferred in a transfer
  
  Available comparision operators are `between`, `gt`, `gteq`, `in`, `is`, `lt`, `lteq`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `currency`: Filter by currency used in a transfer. Currencies supported are native tokens like ETH/ETC, ERC20, ERC721 tokens. For native currencies you can use symbols of them, for contract use address of that contract.

  Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`

- `date`: Filter by date on which transfer happened. Date should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`

  Available comparision operator are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.


- `entityId`: Filter by ERC-721 entity Id

- `external`:

- `height`: Filter by height of Block where transaction happened.

  Available comparision operators are `between`, `gt`, `gteq`, `in`, `is`, `lt`, `lteq`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `options`: Filter returned data by ordering, limiting and constrainting transfer data.
  
  Available fields: `asc`, `ascByInteger`, `desc`, `descByInteger`, `limit`, `limitBy`, `offset` 

- `receiver`: Filter by receiver of the transfer. 
   
  Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`

- `sender`: Filter by sender of the transfer. 
  
  Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`

- `success`: Filter by if transaction is successful or not

- `time`: Filter by time when transfer happened. Time should be in ISO8601-encoded datetime string. Ex, June 17th, 2023 will be `2023-07-17T00:00:00Z`

  Available comparision operator are `after`, `before`, `between`, `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`, `since`, `tiil`.

- `txFrom`: Filter by the address responsible for creating the transaction. Available comparision operators are `in`, `is`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `txHash`: Filter by transaction hash of the transfer.
  
  Available comparision operators are `is`, `in`, `not`, `notIn`.

- `maximum`: returns maximum of selected measurable field of `transfers`
- `minimum`: returns minimum of selected measurable field of `transfers`
- `receiver`: returns receiver of a particular transfer
- `sender`: returns sender of a particular transfer
- `success`: returns boolean value for success of a particular transfer
- `transaction`: returns details of transaction in which a particular transfer
