# Address

The `address` api also allow you pull balance details including balance history.

You can filter using currency smart contract address and get balance for specific currency. In case of native currency, you can just mention "MATIC".

Here is an example on getting balance of [0x198905a3e2e3ffeb20169adf9ceaf0f9e66c35b9](https://explorer.bitquery.io/matic/address/0x198905a3e2e3ffeb20169adf9ceaf0f9e66c35b9):

```
{
  ethereum(network: matic) {
    address(address: {is: "0x198905a3e2e3ffeb20169adf9ceaf0f9e66c35b9"}) {
      balances {
        currency {
          address
          name
          symbol
        }
        value
      }
    }
  }
}

```
