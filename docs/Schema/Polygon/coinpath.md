## Coinpath

The `coinpath` API allows us to retrieve detailed information about flow of funds in the chain.

```
{
  ethereum(network: matic) {
    inbound: coinpath(
      initialAddress: {is: "0xaa5e8d18aae59d1db33d59ccdbb865d2127dd68d"}
      currency: {is: "MATIC"}
      depth: {lteq: 1}
      options: {direction: inbound, asc: "depth", desc: "amount", limitBy: {each: "depth", limit: 10}}
      date: {since: "2023-09-15", till: "2023-09-22"}
    ) {
      sender {
