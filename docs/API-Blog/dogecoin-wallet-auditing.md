## What Data Do They Need?

Auditing a Dogecoin wallet involves collecting and analyzing various types of data. Below are the key data points required:

### Balances and Address Details

To audit a Dogecoin wallet, the first step is to verify the current balance and its updates over time. Auditors need to ensure that the balance reported by the wallet owner matches the balance recorded on the blockchain. This involves retrieving the wallet's balance at specific dates and comparing it to the reported values.

Auditors can use Bitquery APIs and tools to retrieve the current balance and historical balance updates for a Dogecoin wallet. [Check wallet details](https://ide.bitquery.io/wallet-details-of-an-address) and [balance updates](https://ide.bitquery.io/balance-updates-of-a-wallet_1)  for a specific wallet, that is [DHauk5VWNBu73HhpfKPonwTcFqDEntVGzW](https://explorer.bitquery.io/dogecoin/address/DHauk5VWNBu73HhpfKPonwTcFqDEntVGzW), using the Bitquery IDE. You can see some visual representations for the balance updates and the current balance and account details in the below image.

### Client's Trades and Transactions

Understanding a wallet's transaction history is crucial for an accurate audit. Auditors need to review all incoming and outgoing transactions, including trades, payments, and transfers. This helps verify the accuracy of reported transactions and ensures no suspicious or unreported activity. You can use the [Bitquery Explorer](https://explorer.bitquery.io/) to [check the transactions](https://explorer.bitquery.io/dogecoin/address/DHauk5VWNBu73HhpfKPonwTcFqDEntVGzW/transactions) for the wallet mentioned above.
