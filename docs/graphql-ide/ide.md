# How to use the IDE ?

## What is Bitquery IDE?

The Bitquery IDE serves as your gateway to explore and access data from our APIs. This interactive platform provides a visual interface for both V1 and V2 of our APIs.

## How IDE can help build query?

Whether you're new to GraphQL or already familiar with it, the IDE allows you to construct queries in two ways:

1. Query Builder: Leverage the built-in Query Builder to build your queries.
2. Writing Query: If you're well-versed in GraphQL, you can directly write your query within the query area.

If you're new to GraphQL or our APIs, the Query Builder within the IDE offers a user-friendly approach to understanding and creating queries. You can find a step-by-step guide on how to create queries using the Query Builder here.

## How can I save and share queries using IDE?

Should you wish to save or share your queries, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Save" button located above the query area.
2. Provide a name and description for your query.
3. Select the desired visibility setting for your query.
4. Click "Save" to save your query for future use or sharing.

## How do you get my OAuth Token using Bitquery IDE?

1. Click the rightmost person icon in the navbar of IDE to access the dropdown menu.
2. Choose "Account" to access your dashboard.
